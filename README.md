## CONSIDERATIONS

To use this chat, you will need to generate an API Key on the [ChatGPT Plataform]([https://pages.github.com/](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

It will cost you a few dollars to use daily.

## API KEY

To use your API Key, you will need to create a .toml file named secrets. 

And with the code "OPENAI_APIKEY = " enter your API Key and the chat will be ready to be used.
